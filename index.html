     <p>It's no secret that the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry is rapidly expanding as there has been extensive publicity covering fortunes made from investing but most people have no idea about the future applications of blockchain. I’ve been researching and investing small amounts in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and alt coins since 2014 but as I grew older, I started to understand what technology was behind these revolutionary inventions. The common misconception is that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are used to make transactions anonymously and have mainly been used for illegal activities which not only is untrue, but has also distracted from what is so amazing about the Web3. Rather, blockchain is unprecedented because it relies on decentralized consensus algorithms to verify transactions all across the world to post to the blockchain meaning that unless you control more than 50% of the network, there is no centralized authority that can interfere. This has allowed for a technology called smart-contracts (code verifying that predetermined parameters were met before completing a transaction) which will one day replace industries such as banking, supply-chain management, and even one day government. </p>
     <p class="mb-4">Blockchain's captivating potential is that it’s the first trustless system utilizing the same automation that companies have been profiting off for years to put control of the product back in the control of customers. For example, there are decentralized protocols where you can stake your cryptocurrency via an algorithm and it will automatically loan it and return interest. Yes, there are plentiful risks associated with something like this because they are not protected by the FDIC, but one day, we will all be using blockchain banking and all the money that once funnelled into Wall Street as fees is reaped by the network's users.</p>
     <p class="mb-4">For the past 10 years, we've been witnessing the beginning of the largest redistribution of wealth since the industrial revolution and because so few people understand what is happening behind the scenes, we are at risk of a more severe Gilden Age. My goal is to illuminate the possibilities of blockchain technology in overriding legacy systems while also helping educate others about the danger of individuals consolidating so much power. Hopefully, I can work as a designer or product manager for an utility-coin and eventually create my own protocols.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-4 tm-text-color-primary">Statement of Interest: Trading</h2>
      <p>I’ve always been fascinated by the concept of trading (stocks, derivatives, commodities, etc.) and constantly pestered teachers and family to teach me more but every time I thought I understood what was going on it got more complicated. Initially, I was drawn to trading because I was astonished at how fast one could get rich without doing any work but soon realized how much easier it was to lose money than make it. For most of my life, I didn’t have any money to invest but continued to ask questions and learn more. When I realized how diverse markets are and how most traders know nothing other than their specialty, I became hooked by the potential of an industry where curiosity is rewarded. I noticed that trading is an industry where meta-knowledge supersedes all other skills because no matter how many analysts, it takes divergent thought patterns to find new ways to capitalize on equal information.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Trading is further intriguing to me due to the diversity and coexistence of strategy: there are day traders, hedge funds, trading floors, algorithms, and many other different approaches all working in the same system with no consistent winner. It’s a competition between millions of different players where generational wealth can be won or lost in a millisecond. It's the biggest game of poker ever created and the chips are pieces of companies that together make the fabric of our economy. You can leave the table whenever you want but when you come back, your chips may be worth nothing. There is also the potential for players to change the rules or even start a new game. For example, people can invest in leveraged derivatives which allow you to make sidebets on the market and even sidebets on those sidebets. Hence, trading is so interesting to me because it’s constantly evolving, requires quick learning, and is ripe for creative thinking. </p>
