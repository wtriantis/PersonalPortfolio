     <h2 class="mb-4 tm-text-color-primary">Statement of Interest: Blockchain</h2>
     <p>It's no secret that the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry is rapidly expanding as there has been extensive publicity covering fortunes made from investing but most people have no idea about the future applications of blockchain. I’ve been researching and investing small amounts in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and alt coins since 2014 but as I grew older, I started to understand what technology was behind these revolutionary inventions. The common misconception is that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are used to make transactions anonymously and have mainly been used for illegal activities which not only is untrue, but has also distracted from what is so amazing about the Web3. Rather, blockchain is unprecedented because it relies on decentralized consensus algorithms to verify transactions all across the world to post to the blockchain meaning that unless you control more than 50% of the network, there is no centralized authority that can interfere. This has allowed for a technology called smart-contracts (code verifying that predetermined parameters were met before completing a transaction) which will one day replace industries such as banking, supply-chain management, and even one day government. </p>
     <p class="mb-4">Blockchain's captivating potential is that it’s the first trustless system utilizing the same automation that companies have been profiting off for years to put control of the product back in the control of customers. For example, there are decentralized protocols where you can stake your cryptocurrency via an algorithm and it will automatically loan it and return interest. Yes, there are plentiful risks associated with something like this because they are not protected by the FDIC, but one day, we will all be using blockchain banking and all the money that once funnelled into Wall Street as fees is reaped by the network's users.</p>
     <p class="mb-4">For the past 10 years, we've been witnessing the beginning of the largest redistribution of wealth since the industrial revolution and because so few people understand what is happening behind the scenes, we are at risk of a more severe Gilden Age. My goal is to illuminate the possibilities of blockchain technology in overriding legacy systems while also helping educate others about the danger of individuals consolidating so much power. Hopefully, I can work as a designer or product manager for an utility-coin and eventually create my own protocols.</p>

      <h2 class="mb-4 tm-text-color-primary">Statement of Interest: Trading</h2>
      <p>I’ve always been fascinated by the concept of trading (stocks, derivatives, commodities, etc.) and constantly pestered teachers and family to teach me more but every time I thought I understood what was going on it got more complicated. Initially, I was drawn to trading because I was astonished at how fast one could get rich without doing any work but soon realized how much easier it was to lose money than make it. For most of my life, I didn’t have any money to invest but continued to ask questions and learn more. When I realized how diverse markets are and how most traders know nothing other than their specialty, I became hooked by the potential of an industry where curiosity is rewarded. I noticed that trading is an industry where meta-knowledge supersedes all other skills because no matter how many analysts, it takes divergent thought patterns to find new ways to capitalize on equal information.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Trading is further intriguing to me due to the diversity and coexistence of strategy: there are day traders, hedge funds, trading floors, algorithms, and many other different approaches all working in the same system with no consistent winner. It’s a competition between millions of different players where generational wealth can be won or lost in a millisecond. It's the biggest game of poker ever created and the chips are pieces of companies that together make the fabric of our economy. You can leave the table whenever you want but when you come back, your chips may be worth nothing. There is also the potential for players to change the rules or even start a new game. For example, people can invest in leveraged derivatives which allow you to make sidebets on the market and even sidebets on those sidebets. Hence, trading is so interesting to me because it’s constantly evolving, requires quick learning, and is ripe for creative thinking. </p>

      <h2 class="mb-4 tm-text-color-primary">Career Artifact Reflection</h2>
      <p>For my career reflection artifact, I decided to interview my dad, Alex Triantis, because no matter how much I talk to him, he hates being the subject of conversation. His abbreviated story is: He was the son of an economics professor at University of Toronto where he would later study electrical engineering. His entire family was academics so he first immigrated to the US to get an industrial engineering degree at Stanford where he researched mathematical models used in options trading. After that, he taught corporate finance at University of Wisconsin, then the University of Maryland where he transitioned to leadership, and currently Johns Hopkins. He has done some consulting projects on the side like teaching corporate finance to companies but his career path has always interested me because he has stayed in academia his entire life. This taught me that it probably wasn’t a field I would enjoy but it is much more entertaining and expansive than I once thought. It showed me that even if I commit myself to a certain industry or expertise, there is so much overlap between different fields of academia and always opportunities to pivot your career.</p>
        <p>To commemorate him and our informal interview, we talked about different keywords to give an AI image model to portray his career. I took over 30 keywords like “business school”, “professor”, “engineering”, “stock options”, etc. and tried different AI’s with different combinations and orderings of the keywords. The following is the best result and while primitive, it encapsulates a lot of our previous discussions about AI and what makes it so smart and stupid at the same time.</p>

      <p>1.</p>
      <p><b>Situation: </b> A sneaker consignment store was not paying out the agreed upon money on-time and they kept using tactics to deflect my requests and delay my payout. Upon investigation, I learnt that this was a common occurrence and that they weren’t reputable people.</p>
      <p><b>Task: </b> Find a way to extract my money by either leveraging the contract and legal advice to intimidate them or playing dumb and being as nice as possible to ensure that I didn’t make the situation worse.</p>
      <p><b>Action: </b>I was always cordial and understanding with the owner and we made a deal to pay some of the money digitally, some in cash, and the rest in store credit. </p>
      <p><b>Result: </b>I was able to cut ties with this shady businessman and after I resold items which I bought with store credit, I made out with 85% of the money I was owed. 6 months later they were shut down by the Consumer Protection Agency.</p>
      <br />
      <p>2.</p>
      <p><b>Situation: </b>I was doing an internship at an education technology venture capital firm, Mindset Global.</p>
      <p><b>Task: </b>I was tasked by my boss to create a database of foundations and family offices to contact regarding a new funding round.</p>
      <p><b>Action: </b>As I began digging around, I realized that I was wasting time gathering contact information individually so I looked for ways to work smarter, not harder. I started by scraping data from investment records to identify targets. Next, I used a collection of subscription websites to pull emails and phone numbers by bypassing the paywall with inspect elements and getting the data for every company employee. </p>
      <p><b>Result: </b>My boss was so impressed at how many more contacts I came up with than the other interns so he had me explain my process to the other interns.</p>
      <br />
      <p>3.</p>
      <p><b>Situation: </b>SideQuest, a social goal-setting app startup I am a part of, wasn't making any progress developing our backend which we brought someone on to do.</p>
      <p><b>Task: </b>Initiate progress so that we could begin integrating our front end design and rectify disagreements with our backend developer.</p>
      <p><b>Action: </b>We always gave strict deadlines rather than goals which the developer accepted. He ended up delaying twice and giving more illegitimate excuses. We ended up having to fire him the week we were pitching our business at the WashU Skandalaris Venture Competion.</p>
      <p><b>Result: </b>Myself and another team member built a very basic framework and our team learnt the hard lesson that people don’t always want to contribute even if they want to be involved in and take credit for a project. </p>
      <br />
      <p>4.</p>
      <p><b>Situation: </b>When I was a 16 year old camp counselor, myself and two other counselors were leading 15 campers ages 4-12 through the woods to a creak where they always asked to go. The creak was a common activity but incredibly dangerous due to sharp and slippery rocks. When we got there, campers began to disperse and not listen to instructions because they were so excited.</p>
      <p><b>Task: </b>Mitigate the risk of a child getting injured when we didn’t have the resources to properly manage all 15 kids. </p>
      <p><b>Action: </b>I took the two other counselors aside to where the campers couldn’t hear us and raised my voice to demonstrate the severity of a child getting injured on our watch. I asked one to watch a group of 3 of our youngest campers, one to a group of girls who didn’t want to go in the water rather explore, and myself to go around doing headcounts, getting kids out of dangerous areas, and corralling everybody back towards a central location.</p>
      <p><b>Result: </b>I may have disappointed a few campers with my limits on how far they could go or what rocks and water was off limits but luckily nobody got hurt and we were able to implement a protocol for the creak excursion.</p>

It highlights my understanding and continued learning in front-end development as well as my personal passion for the Washington Capitals. This was also when I realized how long it really takes to get the formatting presentable with html and css and that you could spend an hour trying to center an image without ruining the rest of the content.
